Where are we? 
 * Have a project folder tracking along with git repository
 
What are we going to do? 
 * Initialize npm ecosystem
 * Initialize lerna monorepo
 * Create & configure apps

Do the Dew: 
* `yarn init -y && npx lerna init`
* Add a directory for `apps` and map it in `lerna.json`
* `touch .gitignore` and put things in it if it makes sense
